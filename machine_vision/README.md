Machine Vision Tools
===
These tools were created to support the "Machine Vision" extension in [IoTy](https://quirkycort.github.io/IoTy/public/editor.html) and uses the same algorithms.
You may not get the same results if used with other machine vision libraries.

## [yuv_threshold.html](https://quirkycort.github.io/misc/machine_vision/yuv_threshold.html)
Tool for visualizing YUV threshold.
Useful for blob detection in YUV colorspace.
The input file must be a raw YUV binary file.

## [circle_detect.html](https://quirkycort.github.io/misc/machine_vision/circle_detect.html)
Tool for visualizing circle detection.
The input file must be a raw YUV or Grayscale binary file.

## [line_detect.html](https://quirkycort.github.io/misc/machine_vision/line_detect.html)
Tool for visualizing line detection.
The input file must be a raw YUV or Grayscale binary file.
